<h1 class=heading>Linux Desktop</h1>
<div class="linux">
<p>
We encourage and endorse the use of free and open source desktop and server
systems for our clients but we would like to make it clear that our web and
mail services will work with any modern operating system including most if
not all Microsoft&reg;, Apple&reg; and Android&reg; systems and any standard
web browser or email program.
</p>
<p>
<em>Just because we promote the use of Linux based desktop distributions does
not mean that our online services will only work with Linux.</em>
</p>
<h3>Why do we prefer Linux?</h3>
<p>
A few years ago Linux was only considered useful on internet servers and
devices like network routers that connect households and businesses to the
internet itself. Linux desktop systems were hard to use and only suitable
for "nerds", "geeks" and hardcore software developers.
</p>
<p>
These days (2017) that is no longer true. A Linux based desktop or laptop
computer can sometimes be easier to use than a typical Windows or Mac
computer. Not always but in many situations it can often be simpler to get
the job done with a Linux desktop.
</p>
<h3>Points for and against using Linux</h3>
<p>
First we will list some good reasons to consider using Linux and then a
list of what some folks would consider negative points.
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Free</b> as in the cost to install and use Linux except for the time
it takes to understand a different operating system.</li>
<li><b>Free</b> as in open source which means anyone is allowed to copy and
modify Linux systems and give away the results, also for free (ideal for
schools).</li>
<li><b>Secure</b> by default. Common viruses and trojans targetted at
Windows computers will not run on a Linux system so virus checking
software, in general, is not even needed.</b>
<li><b>Privacy</b> in that there are no self-interested direct upstream
parties that want to hijack your personal information for commercial gain.
However certain well known online social media providers will still track
your online data.</li>
<li><b>Efficient</b> enough to run on a wide range of PC desktop and
laptops released in the last 10 years and does not slowdown from
<abbr title="A process whereby successive versions of a
computer program become perceptibly slower,
use more memory, disk space or processing
power, or have higher hardware requirements
than the previous version">software bloat</abbr>
or promotional adware.</li>
<li><b>Maintenance</b> and updating the operating system and installed
application packages is quite easy. New applications are just a click away
without having to pay for them.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The above points summarise the main reasons why we prefer Linux so now
let's look at some negative drawbacks.
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Applications</b>, a large range of high end professional creative
and commercial business class software will not run on Linux. The native
Linux equivalent software is often not up to the same standard and polish
of some proprietary applications.</li>
<li><b>Games</b>, some of the best high end AAA action games will not work
on Linux and even though there is a huge range of games available they
sometimes do not work as efficiently as on a PC or dedicated gaming
console.</li>
<li><b>Mediocre</b> hardware and peripheral support. This is not so much
the case these days, and is steadily improving, but some obscure printers
and external devices have little or no driver support.</li>
<li><b>Fragmented</b>
<abbr title="A collection of software systems,
which are developed and co-evolve
in the same environment">software ecosystem</abbr>
because of the anything goes nature of
many aspects of Linux from a variety of different desktop options to
multiple "distributions" and applications all trying to achieve a similar
end result but ultimately just competing against each other.</li>
<li><b>Support</b> is provided, in most cases, by "the community" rather
than a well-known single upstream provider. This can be a daunting prospect
when a lone Linux user can't call upon friends and family to help with
simple problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>
We could go on and add more pros and cons for using Linux, or not, but
these are some of the most prominent points either way. If the initial
positive points are of interest to you and you are not put off by the
negatives then you either are already using Linux or may very well be a
good candidate to install it on your secondary spare or even your primary
computer. If so then feel free to
